   title     = {The interplay of chaos and dissipation in driven quantum systems},
   abstract  = {Bistable quantum systems show in parameter regimes with mixed
regular/chaotic dynamics a characteristic phenomenon: chaotic tunneling -
coherent transport between regular islands which are separated by a chaotic
layer. In this process, quantum mechanical states which are localized in
chaotic regions of phase space, serve as a bridge between regular regions. The
fact that chaotic states are typically delocalized, results in enhanced
transport - for the present case in larger tunneling rates. As the associated
spectral feature, one finds crossings of chaotic singlets with regular (tunnel)
doublets. The influence of dissipation and the related decoherence on this
tunnel phenomenon is studied in this work. The harmonically driven double well
potential served as a model. It turned out that chaotic tunneling is
accompanyed by enhanced decoherence and that the dynamics involves by far more
than two levels. In the long term limit it results in a steady flow between all
states whose mean energy is below the barrier.
While the influence of the driving has been treated exactly within a Floquet
formalism, it was for an efficient description of the dissipative effects
neccessary to restrict ourselves to weak dissipation. The applicability of the
approximations known from literature, namely Born-Markov and rotating-wave
approximation, has been investigated and a modified approach based on the
Floquet theorem has been derived. Its quality has been studied by means of an
exactly solvable model, the parameterically driven harmonic oscillator. For
this model system we derived analytical solutions of the different master
equations.},

suited for the exact treatment of non-adiabatic driving. While the scattering

amplitudes. With these formalisms, we study different situations like the
transport through driven molecular wires, the dynamics of coherent quantum

by treating the entire driven system within the Floquet formalism and coupling
it to the reservoir as a whole. The different ensuing evolution equations are
compared in various representations, particularly as Fokker-Planck equations
for the Wigner function. On all levels of approximation, these evolution
equations retain the periodicity of the driving, so that their solutions have
Floquet form and represent eigenfunctions of a non-unitary propagator over a
single period of the driving. We discuss asymptotic states in the long-time

results obtained within the different Markov approximations are compared with
the exact path-integral solution. The application of the improved

   abstract  = {Chaotic tunneling in a driven double-well system is
investigated in absence as well as in the presence of dissipation. As the
constitutive mechanism of chaos-assisted tunneling, we focus on the dynamics in
the vicinity of three-level crossings in the quasienergy spectrum. They are
formed when a tunnel doublet, located on a pair of symmetry-related tori in the
classical phase space, approaches a chaotic singlet in energy. The coherent
quantum dynamics near the crossing, in particular the enhanced tunneling that
involves the chaotic singlet state as a ``step stone'', is described
satisfactorily by a three-state model. It fails, however, for the corresponding
dissipative dynamics, because incoherent transitions due to the interaction
with the environment indirectly couple the three states in the crossing to the
remaining quasienergy states. We model dissipation by coupling the double well,
the driving included, to a heat bath. The time dependence of the central
system, with a quasienergy spectrum containing exponentially small tunnel
splittings, requires special considerations when applying the Born-Markov and
rotating-wave approximations to derive a master equation for the density
operator. We discuss the effect of decoherence on the now transient
chaos-assisted tunneling: While decoherence is accelerated practically
independent of temperature near the center of the crossing, it can be stabilzed
with increasing temperature at a chaotic-state induced exact crossing of the
ground-state quasienergies. Moreover the asymptotic amount of coherence left
within the vicinity of the crossing is enhanced if the temperature is below the
splitting of the avoided crossing; but becomes diminished when temperature
raises above the splitting (chaos-induced coherence or incoherence,
respectively). The asymptotic state of the driven dissipative quantum dynamics
partially resembles the, possibly strange, attractor of the corresponding
damped driven classical dynamics, but also exhibits characteristic quantum
effects.},

   abstract  = {The influence of an electron-vibrational coupling on the laser
control of electron transport through a molecular wire that is attached to
several electronic leads is investigated. These molecular vibrational modes
induce an effective electron-electron interaction. In the regime where the wire
electrons couple weakly to both the external leads and the vibrational modes,
we derive within a Hartree-Fock approximation a nonlinear set of quantum
kinetic equations. The quantum kinetic theory is then used to evaluate the
laser driven, time-averaged electron current through the wire-leads contacts.
This novel formalism is applied to two archetypical situations in the presence
of electron-vibrational effects, namely, (i) the generation of a ratchet or
pump current in a symmetrical molecule by a harmonic mixing field and (ii) the
laser switching of the current through the molecule.},

   abstract  = {We consider exciton effects on current in molecular
nanojunctions, using a model comprising a two two-level sites bridge connecting
free electron reservoirs. Expanding the density operator in the many-electron
eigenstates of the uncoupled sites, we obtain a 16x16 density matrix in the
bridge subspace whose dynamics is governed by Liuoville equation that takes
into account interactions on the bridge as well as electron injection and
damping to and from the leads. Our consideration can be considerably simplified
by using the pseudospin description based on the symmetry properties of Lie
group SU(2). We study the influence of the bias voltage, the Coulomb repulsion
and the energy-transfer interactions on the steady-state current and in
particular focus on the effect of the excitonic interaction between bridge
sites. Our calculations show that in case of non-interacting electrons this
interaction leads to reduction in the current at high voltage for a homodimer
bridge. In other words, we predict the effect of exciton blocking. The effect
of exciton blocking is modified for a heterodimer bridge, and disappears for
strong Coulomb repulsion at sites. In the latter case the exciton type
interactions can open new channels for electronic conduction. In particular, in
the case of strong Coulomb repulsion, conduction exists even when the
electronic connectivity does not exist.},

   title     = {Direct measurement of spin-flip rates in single-electron tunneling},
   abstract  = {Spin ﬂips are one of the limiting factors for spin-based
information processing. We demonstrate a transport approach for determining the
spin-ﬂip rates of a self-assembled InAs double quantum dot occupied by a single
electron. In such devices, different Land\'e factors lead to an inhomogeneous
Zeeman splitting, so that the two spin channels can never be at resonance
simultaneously, leading to a spin blockade at low temperatures. This blockade
is analyzed in terms of spin ﬂips for different temperatures and magnetic
ﬁelds. Our results are in good agreement with a quantum master equation that
combines the dot-lead couplings with ohmic dissipation stemming from spin-ﬂip
cotunneling.},

   title     = {Quantum Dissipation at Conical Intersections of Quasienergies},
   abstract  = {We investigate the properties of Floquet states in the vicinity
of a conical intersection of quasienergies and work out the consequences of the
underlying spatio-temporal symmetries for a driven two-level system coupled to
an ohmic heat bath. We find that on manifolds with constant quasienergy
splitting, the mean energies of the Floquet states are continuously
interchanged. In the presence of dissipation, the parameter dependence of the
stationary populations generally resembles that of the mean energies.  In turn,
the mean energies are an indicator for the qualitative behavior of the density
operator in the long-time limit.  A further consequence of the symmetries is
that for specific driving parameters, the stationary state may be fully mixed
even at arbitrarily low temperatures.  For large driving frequencies, such
states with maximal entropy are found in the whole vicinity of the
intersection, which can be explained by a chirality emerging in this limit.
Analytical results beyond a high-frequency approximation are illustrated by
numerical data.},
